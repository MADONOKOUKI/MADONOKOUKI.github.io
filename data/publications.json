    "abstract": "We present an interactive texture segmentation workflow for 3D scanned models. The system combines user guidance with geometric and appearance cues on the surface to produce clean, consistent regions suitable for editing and downstream processing. We evaluate on diverse real scans and report improvements in region accuracy and editing time.",

Using example strokes, our method models stroke appearance and dynamics to generate plausible results that preserve characteristic textures and tapering while remaining controllable for design and illustration workflows.",
